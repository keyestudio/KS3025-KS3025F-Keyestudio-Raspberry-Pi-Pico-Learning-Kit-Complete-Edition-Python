# Project 02: Onboard LED Flashing

**1. Description：**

There is an onboard LED in Raspberry Pi Pico,which is a GP25 pin attached to the Raspberry Pi Pico. In this project, we will learn the effect of making the onboard LED blink.

**3. Wiring up**

In this project, Raspberry Pi Pico is connected to a computer using a USB cable.

**4. Test Code：**

The onboard LED of Raspberry Pi Pico is controlled by GP25. When the GP25 outputs high, the LED will be on; when outputting LOW, the LED will be off.

You can open the code we provide:

```c
/*
 * Filename    : Onboard LED flashing
 * Description : Make an led blinking.
 * Auther      : http//www.keyestudio.com
*/
#define LED_BUILTIN 25

// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
}
```
